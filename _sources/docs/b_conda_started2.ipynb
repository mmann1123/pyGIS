    "# Geospatial Environment Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of software development, package managers have become a fundamental tool for simplifying the installation of software packages and their dependencies. They automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages in a consistent manner. In the field of geospatial data science, where several packages need to be installed, package managers ensure a smooth and efficient setup of your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll talk about `conda` and `mamba`. `Conda` is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux. `Mamba` is a reimplementation of the `conda` package manager in C++. It's designed to be faster and more robust to network issues or packages with tricky dependencies. When working with complex geospatial packages, `mamba` can often be a more efficient choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page provides a guide on how to install `miniconda` or `mamba`, and various geospatial packages including `geowombat` and `geowombat-ml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you will need to **choose between** Miniconda & Mamba. Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. Please follow the instructions from the [Miniconda page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install it on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Mamba\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `mamba` (prefered), please follow the instructions from the [Mamba page](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Activating a New Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new environment in `conda` or `mamba` using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda create --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "or with `mamba`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "mamba create --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "For the remainder of this tutorial we will use `mamba`, but `conda` can be exchanged for `mamba` in all commands.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate this environment, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "mamba activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any package you install will be installed in this environment, keeping it isolated from other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Geospatial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we install the packages, we need to add `conda-forge` to your channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "mamba config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "mamba config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can install `geowombat` and `geowombat-ml` using `conda` or `mamba`. For `mamba`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "mamba install geowombat geowombat-ml\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, we need to install the following packages: `pyproj`, `geopandas`, `contextily`, `earthpy`, `census`, `geoplot`, `osmnx`, `pykrige`, and `us`.  We will start with the packages available through `conda-forge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "mamba install pyproj geopandas       \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally install those packages that aren't available through `conda-forge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "pip install census contextily earthpy geoplot osmnx us pykrige\n",
    "``\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have all the packages installed and ready to be used in your new environment!"
