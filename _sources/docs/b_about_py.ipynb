    "## What\\'s Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming\n",
    "language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van\n",
    "Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the\n",
    "[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one\n",
    "of the most commonly used programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular textbooks on Python programming include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Second Edition\n",
    "With Application to Understanding Data\n",
    "By John V. Guttag \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition\n",
    "A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming\n",
    "by Eric Matthes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains\n",
    "such as\n",
    "\n",
    "-   communications\n",
    "-   web development\n",
    "-   CGI and graphical user interfaces\n",
    "-   game development\n",
    "-   multimedia, data processing, security, etc., etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is beginner-friendly and routinely used to teach computer science and\n",
    "programming in top computer science programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is particularly popular within the scientific and data science\n",
    "communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is steadily [replacing familiar tools like\n",
    "Excel](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/3002556/python-replaced-excel-banking)\n",
    "in the fields of finance and banking.\n",

    "### Relative Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one\n",
    "measure of the relative popularity of Python\n",

    " Python's increasing popularity over time. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure indicates not only that Python is widely used but also that\n",
    "adoption of Python has accelerated significantly since 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is driven at least in part by uptake in the scientific\n",
    "domain, particularly in rapidly growing fields like data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the popularity of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a\n",
    "library for data analysis with Python has exploded, as seen here.\n",
    "\n",

    "    rapidly rising share of scientific work around the globe.\n",

    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)\n",
    "suitable for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries. For instance run the following [The Zen of Python (poem)](https://www.online-python.com/4MW2mnxufk) online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we\\'ll see many\n",
    "examples later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it\\'s highly beneficial\n",
    "because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such\n",
    "routine tasks means that you don\\'t need to break your flow in order to\n",
    "hunt down correct syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions\n",
    "make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve\n",
    "productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the core languages of scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It\\'s either the dominant player or a major player in\n",
