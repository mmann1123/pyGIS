    "To work in a GIS environment, real world observations (objects or events that can be recorded in 2D or 3D space) need to be reduced to spatial entities. These spatial entities can be represented in a GIS as a **vector data model** or a **raster data model**. \n",

    "### Object vs. Field\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional raster/vector representation of our world has primarily been shaped by software and data storage contexts. However, this approach may not always offer meaningful insights when analyzing patterns, as it can sometimes obscure crucial characteristics of the subject under study. A more illuminating approach can be to consider object versus field perspectives, even though they may appear more abstract at first glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object View\n",
    "\n",
    "An object perspective perceives entities as discrete objects, which do not necessarily occur at every location within a study area. For instance, point locations of cities or polygonal representations of urban areas (which may be non-contiguous) serve as examples of an object view. In this perspective, individual items or regions are treated as unique entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are typically stored as vector data - points, lines, polygons. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Field View\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a field perspective treats entities as a scalar field—a mathematical concept where a scalar represents a measurable quantity at every location within the study region. Surface elevation and temperature are common examples of scalar fields, as they reflect a property that can be measured at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the presence or absence of a building. This can be represented as a binary scalar field: a value of 0 for locations without buildings and a value of 1 for locations with one or more buildings. Although it may seem counterintuitive to view buildings as a field—especially given the definition of the object view—buildings can actually be represented from both perspectives. The choice between an object or field view ultimately depends on the context of the analysis. If the focus is on studying the distribution of buildings across an area, an object view is suitable. However, if the aim is to identify all locations without buildings, a binary field perspective becomes more relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields are typically stored as raster data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale\n",
    "The method for representing real-world entities in a GIS is often significantly influenced by the **scale** of the analysis. In a GIS context, scale refers to the ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance in the real world. Therefore, a **large-scale** map indicates a large ratio and typically covers a small geographic extent. This definition might seem counterintuitive because, in everyday language, 'large scale' is often interpreted as referring to a broad scope or extensive area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two maps below illustrate this concept by representing the same area—Boston—but at different scales. When the scale is small (e.g., 1:10,000,000), representing Boston and other cities as points can be an effective approach. Conversely, when the scale is large (e.g., 1:34,000), it might be more suitable to represent Boston as a polygon. Furthermore, at this larger scale, roads might be better depicted as polygons rather than polylines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/img/Boston_small_scale.jpg\n",
    ":name: Boston small scale\n",
    ":alt: Small scale map of Boston\n",
    "\n",
    "Map of the Boston area at a 1:10,000,000 scale. In geographical terms, this is considered a small scale, although in common parlance, the extensive area it covers would often be referred to as 'large scale.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/img/Boston_large_scale.jpg\n",
    ":name: Boston large scale\n",
    ":alt: Large scale map of Boston\n",
    "\n",
    "Map of the Boston area at a 1:34,000 scale. In geographical terms, this is considered a large scale, although in common parlance, the limited area it covers would often be referred to as 'small scale.'\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "### Attribute Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Geographic Information System (GIS), non-spatial data linked to a spatial feature are known as **attributes**. A spatial feature on a GIS map corresponds to a record in the attribute table, connected by a unique numerical feature identifier (FID). Every feature in a layer possesses an identifier. Understanding the one-to-one or many-to-one relationship between the feature and its attribute record is crucial. Due to this linkage, many GIS software allow you to click on a map feature and display its associated attributes from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data can also contain attributes, but only if the pixels are represented by a unique set of integer values. Raster datasets with attribute tables typically have cell values that define a category or membership. However, it's important to note that not all GIS raster data formats can store attribute information; in fact, many raster datasets used in GIS work may not have attribute tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes can be categorized into four **measurement levels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nominal** data are non-numeric and have no implied order or size (e.g., types of roads like paved and unpaved). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ordinal** data have an inherent order (e.g., rank-based scores), but the magnitude of the difference is not quantifiable as they lack a linear scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interval** data are numeric with a linear scale but lack a true zero. Thus, they can't measure relative magnitudes. For instance, you can't say that 60°F is twice as warm as 30°F because these temperatures correspond to different values in Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ratio** scale data, like interval data, also have a linear scale but with a true zero. This makes them suitable for representing relative magnitudes (e.g., monetary values like $1, $20, $100).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes can also be categorized by their **data type**. ArcGIS supports several data types, including **integer, float, double, and text**. The type of data and its measurement level should inform its storage format in a GIS environment. The following table outlines common data types supported by most GIS applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Stored values | Note |\n",
    "| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |\n",
    "| Short integer | -32,768 to 32,768 | Whole numbers |\n",
    "| Long integer | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648 | Whole numbers |\n",
    "| Float | -3.4 * E-38 to 1.2 E38 | Real numbers |\n",
    "| Double | -2.2 * E-308 to 1.8 * E308 | Real numbers |\n",
    "| Text | Up to 64,000 characters | Letters and words |\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to store whole numbers as a float or double, doing so increases storage space, which can impact performance for large datasets. Furthermore, storing a float as an integer could lead to significant data loss, as the system would round off decimal numbers to the nearest whole number. For example, the float values 0.2, 0.01, 0.34, 0.1, and 0.876 would be converted to 0, 0, 0, 0, and 1 as integers."
