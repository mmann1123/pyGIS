    "\n",
    "Either\n",
    "\n",
    "-   search for Jupyter in your applications menu, or\n",
    "-   open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "    - Windows users should substitute \\\"Anaconda command prompt\\\" for \\\"terminal\\\" in the previous line.\n",
    "\n",

    "-   `localhost` is the name of the local machine\n",

    "Thus, the Jupyter kernel is listening for Python commands on port 8888 of our\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look at the URL at the top, it should be `localhost:8888` or\n",
    "similar, matching the message above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming all this has worked OK, you can now click on `New` at the top\n",

    "### Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s start with how to edit code and run simple programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, in the previous figure, the cell is surrounded by a green\n",
    "border.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the cell is in *edit mode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mode, whatever you type will appear in the cell with the\n",
    "flashing cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you\\'re ready to execute the code in a cell, hit `Shift-Enter`\n",
    "instead of the usual `Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb3.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell\n",
    "that you can find by exploring)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modal Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses\n",
    "a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which\n",
    "mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Edit mode\n",
    "    -   Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor\n",
    "    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell\n",
    "2.  Command mode\n",
    "    -   The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border\n",
    "    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch to\n",
    "-   command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`\n",
    "-   edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you\n",
    "get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html),\n",
    "allowing the use of characters such as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as names in\n",
    "your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous program, we executed the line `import numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   NumPy is a numerical library we\\'ll work with in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this import command, functions in NumPy can be accessed with\n",
    "`np.function_name` type syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For example, try `np.random.randn(3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can explore these attributes of `np` using the `Tab` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we type `np.ran` and hit Tab\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter offers up the two possible completions, `random` and `rank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the Tab key helps remind you of what\\'s available and also\n",
    "saves you typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "(gs_help)=\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On-Line Help\n",
    "\n",
    "To get help on `np.rank`, say, we can execute `np.rank?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation appears in a split window of the browser, like so\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6a.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the top right of the lower split closes the on-line help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Content\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to executing code, the Jupyter notebook allows you to embed\n",
    "text, equations, figures and even videos in the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we enter a mixture of plain text and LaTeX instead of\n",
    "code\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb7.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we `Esc` to enter command mode and then type `m` to indicate that\n",
    "we are writing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),\n",
    "a mark-up language similar to (but simpler than) LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can also use your mouse to select `Markdown` from the `Code`\n",
    "drop-down box just below the list of menu items)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we `Shift+Enter` to produce this\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb8.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharing Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook files are just text files structured in\n",
    "[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and typically ending with\n",
    "`.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can share them in the usual way that you share files --- or by\n",
    "using web services such as [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks you see on that site are **static** html representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run one, download it as an `ipynb` file by clicking on the download\n",
    "icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save it somewhere, navigate to it from the Jupyter dashboard and then\n",
    "run as discussed above.\n",
