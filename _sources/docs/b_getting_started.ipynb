    "\n",
    "This means that the cell is in *edit mode*.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you\\'re ready to execute the code in a cell, hit `Shift-Enter`\n",
    "instead of the usual `Enter`.\n",

    "that you can find by exploring)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modal Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses\n",
    "a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which\n",
    "mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Edit mode\n",
    "    -   Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor\n",
    "    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell\n",
    "2.  Command mode\n",
    "    -   The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border\n",
    "    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch to\n",
    "-   command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`\n",
    "-   edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you\n",
    "get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html),\n",
    "allowing the use of characters such as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as names in\n",
    "your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a code cell, try typing `\\alpha` and then hitting the\n",
    "`tab` key on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a_test_program)=\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Test Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s run a test program.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google. It allows you to write and execute Python code, similar to Jupyter Notebooks, but without the need for local installations. Google Colab provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, which can be beneficial for resource-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "To access Google Colab, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a web browser and navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "2. Sign in to your Google account or create one if you don't have it already.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a New Colab Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are signed in, you can create a new Colab notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the \"NEW NOTEBOOK\" button on the left sidebar or go to \"File\" > \"New notebook.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Code in Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Running code in Google Colab is similar to Jupyter Notebooks. You can create code cells and execute them using Shift+Enter or by clicking the \"Play\" button in the top left of each cell."
