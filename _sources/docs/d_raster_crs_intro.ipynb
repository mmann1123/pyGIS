    "Raster data is very different that vector data, one of the key differences is that we don't have a pair of coordinates (x,y) for each pixel in a raster. How then do we know where the raster is located in addition to what the data values are? For a new spatial raster (e.g. geotif) we need to store a few other pieces of information seperately. We need to keep track of the location of the upper left hand corner, the resolution (in both the x and y direction) and a description of the coordinate space (i.e. the CRS), amongst others.\n",

    "\n",
    "The projection concepts described in the previous section apply equally to rasters. However, there are important differences in reprojection of vectors and rasters: transforming a vector object involves changing the coordinates of every vertex but this does not apply to raster data. Rasters are composed of rectangular cells of the same size (expressed by map units, such as degrees or meters), so it is impossible to transform coordinates of pixels separately. Raster reprojection involves creating a new raster object, often with a different number of columns and rows than the original. The attributes must subsequently be re-estimated, allowing the new pixels to be ‘filled’ with appropriate values. In other words, raster reprojection can be thought of as two separate spatial operations: a vector reprojection of cell centroids to another CRS (Section 6.4), and computation of new pixel values through resampling (Section 5.3.3). Thus in most cases when both raster and vector data are used, it is better to avoid reprojecting rasters and reproject vectors instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raster reprojection process is done with projectRaster() from the raster package. Like the st_transform() function demonstrated in the previous section, projectRaster() takes a geographic object (a raster dataset in this case) and a crs argument. However, projectRaster() only accepts the lengthy proj4string definitions of a CRS rather than concise EPSG codes.\n",
    "It is possible to use a EPSG code in a proj4string definition with \"+init=epsg:MY_NUMBER\". For example, one can use the \"+init=epsg:4326\" definition to set CRS to WGS84 (EPSG code of 4326). The PROJ library automatically adds the rest of the parameters and converts them into \"+init=epsg:4326 +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0\".\n",

The first step is to obtain the PROJ definition of this CRS, which can be done using the http://spatialreference.org webpage.
