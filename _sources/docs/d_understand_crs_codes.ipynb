    "A coordinate reference system tells Python where and how to place coordinates on Earth's surface. For a detailed lesson on projections please go [here](d_crs_what_is_it).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, a coordinate reference system can either be a geographic coordinate system or a projected coordinate system (also known as a map projection). A geographic coordinate system consists of a datum, which consists of an ellipsoid model and how this ellipsoid is aligned with the geoid. It's spherical in nature, and units are typically angular (latitude and longitude). A projected coordinate system is created by taking a geographic coordinate system and using math to transform a 3-D surface onto a flat, 2-D surface. Units are typically linear and are oftentimes measured in meters. For a refresher on coordinate systems, check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/HnWNhyxyUHg).\n",
    "\n",
    "All map projections introduce error because they are inherently imperfect. The \"best\" or \"perfect\" projection to use is highly dependent on what needs to be mapped and where. Therefore, as you can expect, there are many projections to choose from.\n",
