    "\n",
    "The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas implements two main data structures, a `GeoSeries` and a `GeoDataFrame`. These are subclasses of pandas Series and DataFrame, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoSeries\n",
    "\n",
    "A `GeoSeries` is essentially a vector where each entry in the vector is a set of shapes corresponding to one observation. An entry may consist of only one shape (like a single polygon) or multiple shapes that are meant to be thought of as one observation (like the many polygons that make up the State of Hawaii or a country like Indonesia).\n",

    "A `GeoDataFrame` is a tabular data structure that contains a `GeoSeries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important property of a `GeoDataFrame` is that it always has one `GeoSeries` column that holds a special status. This `GeoSeries` is referred to as the `GeoDataFrame’s` “geometry”. When a spatial method is applied to a `GeoDataFrame` (or a spatial attribute like area is called), this commands will always act on the “geometry” column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “geometry” column – no matter its name – can be accessed through the geometry attribute (gdf.geometry), and the name of the geometry column can be found by typing gdf.geometry.name.\n",

    "A `GeoDataFrame` may also contain other columns with geometrical (shapely) objects, but only one column can be the active geometry at a time. To change which column is the active geometry column, use the `GeoDataFrame.set_geometry()` method.\n",
