    "# Geospatial Raster Data \n",
    "A raster data model uses an array of cells, or pixels, to represent real-world objects. Raster datasets are commonly used for representing and managing imagery, surface temperatures, digital elevation models, and numerous other entities. A raster can be thought of as a special case of an area object where the area is divided into a regular grid of cells. But a regularly spaced array of marked points may be a better analogy since rasters are stored as an array of values where each cell is defined by a single coordinate pair inside of most GIS environments. Implicit in a raster data model is a value associated with each cell or pixel. This is in contrast to a vector model that may or may not have a value associated with the geometric primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work with raster data we will be using `rasterio` and later `geowombat`. Behind the scenes a `numpy.ndarray` does all the heavy lifting. To understand how raster works it helps to construct one from scratch. \n",
