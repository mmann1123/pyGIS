Thiessen polygons are be constructed around each sampled point so all the space within a specific polygon is closest in distance to that sampled point (as compared to other sampled points). Then, to perform nearest neighbor interpolation, all that space is assigned the value of that sampled point. [^bolstad]\n",

Consequently, these infinite regions will not be exported. To mitigate this issue, we can create dummy points well beyond the extent of our datasets, which will create finite Voronoi regions for all of our actual sample points. Then, we can clip the regions to our extent shapefile (creating dummy points far away from our actual sample points will ensure the dummy points and their infinite Voronoi regions do not interfere with the sample points and their associated finite Voronoi regions after all regions are clipped).\n",

Thus, the semivariogram determines how much influence a known point has on an unknown point as the distance between the known point and the unknown point increases. In other words, the weight of a known point on an unknown point decreases with increasing distance, and the semivariogram determines how quickly that weight tapers with increasing distance.
