    "Either\n",
    "\n",
    "-   search for Jupyter in your applications menu, or\n",
    "-   open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`\n",

    "similar, matching the message above.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s start with how to edit code and run simple programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, in the previous figure, the cell is surrounded by a green\n",
    "border.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the cell is in *edit mode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mode, whatever you type will appear in the cell with the\n",
    "flashing cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you\\'re ready to execute the code in a cell, hit `Shift-Enter`\n",
    "instead of the usual `Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb3.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell\n",
    "that you can find by exploring)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modal Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses\n",
    "a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which\n",
    "mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Edit mode\n",
    "    -   Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor\n",
    "    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell\n",
    "2.  Command mode\n",
    "    -   The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border\n",
    "    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch to\n",
    "-   command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`\n",
    "-   edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you\n",
    "get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html),\n",
    "allowing the use of characters such as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as names in\n",
    "your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   For example, try `np.random.randn(3)`.\n",
    "\n",

    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter offers up the two possible completions, `random` and `rank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the Tab key helps remind you of what\\'s available and also\n",
    "saves you typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "(gs_help)=\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On-Line Help\n",
    "\n",
    "To get help on `np.rank`, say, we can execute `np.rank?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation appears in a split window of the browser, like so\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6a.png\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the top right of the lower split closes the on-line help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Content\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to executing code, the Jupyter notebook allows you to embed\n",
    "text, equations, figures and even videos in the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here we enter a mixture of plain text and LaTeX instead of\n",

    "Next we `Esc` to enter command mode and then type `m` to indicate that\n",
    "we are writing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),\n",
    "a mark-up language similar to (but simpler than) LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You can also use your mouse to select `Markdown` from the `Code`\n",
    "drop-down box just below the list of menu items)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we `Shift+Enter` to produce this\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sharing Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook files are just text files structured in\n",
    "[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and typically ending with\n",
    "`.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",

    "using web services such as [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
