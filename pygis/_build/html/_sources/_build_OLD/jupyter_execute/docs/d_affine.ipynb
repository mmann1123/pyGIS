    "Affine transformations allows us to use simple systems of linear equations to manipulate any point or set of points. It allows us to move, stretch, or even rotate a point or set of points. In the case of GIS, it is used to distort raster data, for instance satellite imagery, to fit a new projection or CRS. \n",
