    "# Vector Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)\n",
    "When it comes to coordinate reference systems points, lines and polygons are convenient because each point or node has an assigned coordinate pair (x,y). The only trick then is to know how those coordinates relate to the coordinate space, or location on the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Define a Projection for Points, Lines, Polygons\n",
    "When a point, line or polyon is created each point or node has two coordinates `x` and `y`. The location of these two points on the ground will change wildly between projections. The coordinate pair (0,0) might mean a location just off shore from Ghana with WGS84 LatLon, or in the middle of the Pacific ocean in another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the example of a polygon with coordinates (0,45),(5,45),(5,40),(0,40) below. In the left pane we can see that, although we have the polygon's node coordinates, we don't know where they are located! This is because no coordinate reference system has been assigned to it. Could be in outer space for all we know. On the right, we can see that we have assigned it WGS84 geographic lat lon i.e. `EPSG:4326`. Suddenly the coordinates make sense, because we know how they relate to locations on the ground.   \n",

    " Affine transformation is any transformation that preserves lines and parallelism. However, angles or length are not necessarily preserved. Affine transformations include, among others, shifting (translation), scaling and rotation. Additionally, it is possible to use any combination of these. Affine transformations are an essential part of geocomputation. For example, shifting is needed for labels placement, scaling is used in non-contiguous area cartograms (see Section 8.6), and many affine transformations are applied when reprojecting or improving the geometry that was created based on a distorted or wrongly projected map. The sf package implements affine transformation for objects of classes sfg and sfc.\n",

In the example below, each geometry is shrunk by a factor of two around the centroids (middle panel in Figure 5.5). To achieve that, each object is firstly shifted in a way that its center has coordinates of 0, 0 ((nz_sfc - nz_centroid_sfc)). Next, the sizes of the geometries are reduced by half (* 0.5). Finally, each object’s centroid is moved back to the input data coordinates (+ nz_centroid_sfc).\n",
