# # Opening Remote Sensed Images
# 
# GeoWombat's file opening is meant to mimic Xarray and Rasterio. That is, rasters are typically opened with a context manager using the function `geowombat.open`. GeoWombat uses `xarray.open_rasterio` to load data into an `xarray.DataArray`. In GeoWombat, the data are always chunked, meaning the data are always loaded as Dask arrays. As with `xarray.open_rasterio`, the opened DataArrays always have at least 1 band.
# 
# ## Opening a single image
# 
# Opening an image with default settings looks similar to `xarray.open_rasterio` and `rasterio.open`. `geowombat.open` expects a file name (`str` or `pathlib.Path`).

# In[1]:


import geowombat as gw
from geowombat.data import l8_224078_20200518
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with gw.open(l8_224078_20200518) as src:
    print(src)


# In the example above, `src` is an `xarray.DataArray`. Thus, printing the object will display the underlying Dask array dimensions and chunks, the DataArray named coordinates, and the DataArray attributes.
# 
# It automatically converts the coordinates stored in `x` and `y`, and the different bands are stored in `band`. To select a single band we can simply select it with `src.sel(band=1)`.  
# 
# Let's plot out what we have while removing missing values, stored at `0`, and switch the band order around to be RGB.

# In[ ]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=200)
with gw.open(l8_224078_20200518) as src:
    src.where(src != 0).sel(band=[3, 2, 1]).gw.imshow(robust=True, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout(pad=1)


# ## Opening multiple bands as a stack
# 
# Often, satellite bands will be stored in separate raster files. To open the files as one DataArray, specify a list instead of a file name.

# In[ ]:


from geowombat.data import l8_224078_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B3, l8_224078_20200518_B4

with gw.open([l8_224078_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B3, l8_224078_20200518_B4]) as src:
    print(src)


# By default, GeoWombat will stack multiple files by time. So, to stack multiple bands with the same timestamp, change the `stack_dim` keyword.
# 
# Also note the use of `band_names` parameter. Here we can set it to anything we want for instance `['blue','green','red']`.

from geowombat.data import l8_224078_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B3, l8_224078_20200518_B4

with gw.open(
    [l8_224078_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B3, l8_224078_20200518_B4],
    stack_dim="band",
    band_names=[1, 2, 3],
) as src:
    print(src)


# You will see this looks the same as the multiband raster:

# In[ ]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=200)
with gw.open(
    [l8_224078_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B3, l8_224078_20200518_B4],
    stack_dim="band",
    band_names=['blue','green','red'],
) as src:
    src.where(src != 0).sel(band=['red','blue','green']).gw.imshow(robust=True, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout(pad=1)


# ```{note} 
# If time names are not specified with ``stack_dim`` = 'time', GeoWombat will attempt to parse dates from the file names. This could incur significant overhead when the file list is long. Therefore, it is good practice to specify the time names.
# ```
# Overhead required to parse file names
# 
# ```python
# with gw.open(long_file_list, stack_dim='time') as src:
#       ...
# ```
# 
# No file parsing overhead
# 
# ```python
# with gw.open(long_file_list, time_names=my_time_names, stack_dim='time') as src:
#     ...
# ```
# ## Opening images from different sensors
# One of many complications of using remotely sensed data is that there are so many different sensors such as LandSat, Sentinel, PlantScope etc each with their own band order and properties. Geowombat makes this much easier by providing a broad list of potential sensor configurations. [Read in more detail about sensor configurations here.](f_rs_crs_sensors) For this section, let's keep things simple and show you how to open a Sentinel 2 image using the configuration manager, frankly, it's pretty easy:
# 
# ``` python
# with gw.config.update(sensor='s2'):
#     with gw.open('filepath.tif') as src:
#         print(src.band)
# ```
# 
# To see all available sensor names, use the **avail_sensors** property.
# 
# ``` python
# with gw.open('filepath.tif') as src:
#     for sensor_name in src.gw.avail_sensors:
#         print(sensor_name)
# ```
# 
# ## Opening multiple bands as a mosaic
# 
# When a list of files are given, GeoWombat will stack the data by default. To mosaic multiple files into the same band coordinate, use the **mosaic** keyword.

# In[ ]:


from geowombat.data import l8_224077_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B2

with gw.open([l8_224077_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B2],
              mosaic=True) as src:
    print(src)


# Now let's take a look at the mosaiced band 2 image values.

# In[ ]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=200)
with gw.open([l8_224077_20200518_B2, l8_224078_20200518_B2],
              mosaic=True) as src:
    src.where(src != 0).sel(band=1).gw.imshow(robust=True, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout(pad=1)


# <!-- See :ref:`io` for more examples illustrating file opening. -->
# 
# ## Create a Time Series Stack
# Let's pretend for a moment that we have a time series of images from the same tile. We can stack them by passing a list of file names `[l8_224078_20200518, l8_224078_20200518]`, it also helps to be specific and assign `time_names=['t1', 't2']`, and specify which dimension we want to stack our data along with `stack_dim='time'`.

# In[ ]:


with gw.open([l8_224078_20200518, l8_224078_20200518],
            band_names=['blue', 'green', 'red'],
            time_names=['t1', 't2'],
            stack_dim='time') as src:
    print(src)


# ## Writing DataArrays to file
# 
# GeoWombat's I/O can be accessed through the `to_vrt` and `to_raster` functions. These functions use
# Rasterio's `write` and Dask.array `store` functions as I/O backends. In the examples below,
# ``src`` is an ``xarray.DataArray`` with the necessary transform information to write to an image file.
# 
# Write to a VRT file.
# 
# 
# ``` python
# import geowombat as gw
# from geowombat.data import l8_224077_20200518_B4
# 
# # Transform the data to lat/lon
# with gw.config.update(ref_crs=4326):
# 
#     with gw.open(l8_224077_20200518_B4, chunks=1024) as src:
# 
#         # Write the data to a VRT
#         gw.to_vrt(src, 'lat_lon_file.vrt')
# ```
# 
# Write to a raster file.

# In[ ]:


import geowombat as gw

with gw.open(l8_224077_20200518_B4, chunks=1024) as src:

    # Xarray drops attributes
    attrs = src.attrs.copy()

    # Apply operations on the DataArray
    src = src * 10.0

    src.attrs = attrs

    # Write the data to a GeoTiff
    src.gw.to_raster('output.tif',
